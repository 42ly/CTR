# Cain

Cain is a dungeon crawling roguelike where you try to survive by making optimal decisions, solving puzzles, and descending through hell.
Each dungeon level is procedurally generated, the demons have random mutations that scale with the level along with items and currency drops.
The hp system is body part based for added randomness and complexity.
You can kill demons with your mind and melee.
