The main idea behind the project was to promote cognitive development and general cognitive improvement by gamifying cognitive tasks.

This is a prototype for a cognitive task centered, dungeon crawler roguelike. The concept was that you could replenish and improve stats by doing cognitive tasks. I have implemented the arithmetic task, but I had planned on adding matrix reasoning, logic, visual memory, and numerical memory tasks. I might in the future, but I see this as a completed prototype.

It uses a procedural dungeon generation system that I made.
