# Cain

Through either pure unluckiness or stupidity Cain Laboratories has opened a portal to a hellish universe governed by a superintelligent demonic hivemind. Surprisingly, all lab members perished. Thankfully, the lab is incredibly difficult to escape. Sadly, you, the intelligent robot Ab3l, have awoken only to find yourself smothered in you creator's ectoplasm...

Now you have to make it out and save humanity by solving puzzles put in place for you to fine tune your mind and by using the labs various tools to turn the hivemind into a fine strawberry jam. Good luck.
