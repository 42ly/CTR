# Cain

This is a prototype for a cognitive task centered roguelike. The concept was that you could replenish and improve stats by doing cognitive tasks.

I have only implemented the arithmetic task, but I had planned on adding matrix reasoning, logic, visual memory, and numerical memory tasks.

I might in the future, but I see this as a completed prototype.
